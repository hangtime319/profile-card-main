# Profile Card Component

A simple, responsive profile card component, styled with pure HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Profile card component" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to build a clean and modern single-component design. This project is an excellent example of using a **utility-first CSS framework** to quickly style a component without writing any custom CSS. It demonstrates a solid understanding of HTML structure and the efficiency of Tailwind for a streamlined styling workflow.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the profile card, including the profile picture, user information, and statistics.
* **Tailwind CSS:** This project was styled entirely with Tailwind's utility classes. These classes were used to handle all aspects of the design, including layout, colors, spacing, and typography, making the development process fast and efficient.
* **JavaScript:** This is a purely static project. No JavaScript was required for any functionality.

## Installation

This is a static frontend project, so no complex setup is required. The Tailwind CSS is already compiled. To get a local copy, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/profile-card-main.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/profile-card-main.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a single, self-contained component. It displays a user profile with personal details and social statistics, demonstrating a clean and professional UI design that is ready to be integrated into a larger website or application.

## Features

* **Utility-First Styling:** The entire UI is built by composing Tailwind's utility classes directly in the HTML.
* **Fully Responsive:** The card is optimized to look great on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is simple, professional, and visually appealing, with a clear focus on readability.
* **Pure HTML/Tailwind:** The entire project is built without a single line of custom CSS or JavaScript.
